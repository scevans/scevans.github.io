The overarching theme in my research thus far concerns developing programmatic pipelines to integrate anchored nuclear and transcriptome sequence data for phylogenetic analyses. Beyond this, I am endeavoring to build a toolkit of experience in systematics and informatics applicable to broad questions in evolutionary biology and interfacing fields.

### Resolving deep relationships among the Salticidae via phylogenomics

I am working to better resolve relationships among the major Salticidae clades, via an integrative phylogenomic approach. I am using [anchored enrichment](http://anchoredphylogeny.com/), a technique that uses broad probe sets to sequence hundreds of unlinked "anchored" regions in the genome. I aim to combine these data with transcriptomes from additional taxa, both within the Salticidae and representatives of closely-related families within the large [RTA clade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTA_clade) of predominantly cursorial spiders.

### A genome-wide phylogeny of the Harmochirina

Additionally, I am working towards a genome-wide phylogeny of the Harmochirina, a clade of nearly 300 species in 15 genera. My primary objective here is to resolve the broader phylogenetic context of the charismatic *Habronattus* salticids. These spiders’ males [exhibit a level of courtship complexity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGZwZlcCnDE) that, in the animal kingdom, is rivaled only by the Australian *Maratus* “peacock” jumping spiders and the famous birds of paradise. *Habronattus* contains several species groups, some of whose exact phylogenetic placement is in question. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that some North American members of the sister group *Pellenes* might fall within *Habronattus*. Given the comparatively mundane courtship of *Pellenes* and other harmochirines, confidently establishing the monophyly of *Habronattus* and the overall structure of the harmochirines is important for constructing hypotheses regarding the pattern of courtship evolution (and possible hybridization) within the *Habronattus* themselves.

### A taxonomic revision of the Australasian genus *Nungia*

The Australasian genus *Nungia* currently contains only one described species, *N. epigynalis*, known only from a female holotype. Yet, many more undescribed species plausibly belong in this genus, and interesting questions lie beyond taxonomic revision, such as patterns of distribution across the Wallace Line.
