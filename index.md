My dissertation involves a multi-faceted approach to understanding jumping spider (Araneae: Salticidae) evolution, grounded in molecular phylogenetics.

I have previously studied aspects of terrestrial arthropod behaviour, chemical ecology, evolutionary ecology theory, and biomechanics.

I have a broader putative interest in extending my research to the interface of evolutionary theory and the interdisciplinary concepts of information and communication.
