*Note: As of January 2017, I am on a temporary leave-of-absence from my PhD studies. I am actively seeking employment, and am available as a [freelance data scientist](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01548a67058bb2e0ad/).*

I study jumping spider (Araneae: Salticidae) evolution, by integrating genomic and transcriptomic data to infer phylogenies. I have previously studied aspects of terrestrial arthropod behaviour, chemical ecology, evolutionary ecology theory, and biomechanics. I have a broader putative interest in extending my research to the interface of evolutionary theory and the interdisciplinary concepts of information and communication.

You may contact me at [samuel.craig.evans@gmail.com](mailto:samuel.craig.evans@gmail.com). 
I am working towards proficiently sharing my data and source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/scevans).
